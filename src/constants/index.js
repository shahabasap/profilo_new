export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a driven and self-taught MERN stack developer who has spent over a year mastering the craft of web development through focused self-learning and a comprehensive one-year boot camp program. My journey is defined by curiosity, determination, and a passion for creating impactful digital solutions.
